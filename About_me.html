        <h1>Hi Everyone, My name is Chris.</h1>
        <p>
            I began working on this website project to continue on my learning journey
            in the technology space. I started my IT journey in 2018 when I decided to
            return to school to complete my Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity. Landing my first job
            outside of my automotive career with a Managed Service Provider, I was quickly
            introduced to the fast-paced world of Information Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my first year with the new MSP, I progressed quickly through the
            field taking on larger projects and more integral tasks with my team. This experience
            was a true blessing. As someone with no formal IT experience or schooling, I was able
            to prove my willingness to learn and grow within the field. Finalizing my time with my first company,
            I found an opportunity to move closer to home and continue on with another Managed Service Provider
            and take on a new set of challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time I completed my Bachelor's Degree and chased my
            first Cybersecurity-related certification, the Security+. After successfully completing the
            certification, I became fully invested in the IT space. Ever-changing technology drives
            me to expand my knowledge in the field and stay at the forefront of the industry.
