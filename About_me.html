    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Hi Everyone, My name is Chris. </h2>
    <p>
        I began working on this website project to continue on my learning journey<br>
        in the technology space. I started my IT journey in 2018 when I decided to<br>
        return to school to complete my Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity. Landing my first job<br>
        outside of my automotive career with a Managed Service Provider, I was quickly<br>
        introduced to the fast-paced world of Information Technology.
    </p>

    <p>
        During my first year with the new MSP, I had progressed quickly through the<br>
        field taking on larger projects and more integral tasks with my team. This experience<br>
        was a true blessing as for someone with no formal IT experience or schooling I was able<br>
        to prove my willingness to learn and grow within the field. Finalizing my time with my first company<br>
        I found an opportunity to move closer to home and continue on with another Managed Service Provider<br>
        and take on a new set of challenges. During this time I completed my Bachelors Degree and chased my<br>
        my first Cybersecurity related certification, the Security+. After successfully completing the<br>
        certification, I had become fully invested in the IT space. Ever-changing technology drives<br>
        me to expand my knowledge in field and stay at the forefront of the industry.
